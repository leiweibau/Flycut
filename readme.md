Flycut is a clean and simple clipboard manager for developers. Based on the open source app [Jumpcut](https://github.com/snark/jumpcut).

This is an actively maintained fork, updated to work on the latest macOS versions.

Every time you copy a code piece, Flycut stores it in history. Later, you can paste it using Shift-Command-V even if you have something different in your current clipboard. You can change the hotkey and other settings in preferences.

## Install

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/haad/Flycut/releases)
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag Flycut to your Applications folder
3. Launch Flycut — macOS will show a warning because the app is not from the App Store
4. Go to **System Settings -> Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**
5. Launch Flycut again
6. Go to **System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility** and enable Flycut — this is required for Flycut to paste on your behalf
